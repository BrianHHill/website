## Contributing

- Please pick a card from the current sprint in [JIRA](https://firemap.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=3&projectKey=CAD&view=planning&issueLimit=100).
- If you create a new ticket in JIRA and it's a development ticket, remember to set the `development` label.
- We are doing [feature branching](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) so your branch name should be `CAD-XX`
- All commits should pass `yarn lint` before pushing (or the pipeline will fail)
- Commit messages should ideally be `[CAD-XX][<NAME>]<GITMOJI> what you did`. E.g.: `[CAD-66][Derwent] ðŸš² Bye, SQL!`
- [Gitmoji reference here](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) and [here](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Gitmoji.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index) - please copy the unicode gitmoji from the second guide, not just `:emoji:`
- When you've submitted a PR, set the status of the ticket to `Review` and ask for a reviewer
- When someone has merged the PR into master, check that it passes all of the tests in [the pipeline](https://github.com/CrisisRelief/website/actions) and deploys to prod.
- Only then, can you set it to done.
