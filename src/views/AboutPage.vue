      <h2>About Crisis App</h2>
      <p>CrisisApp was forged in the 2019-2020 Australian Bushfires as a group of skilled, committed volunteers and organisations wanting to connect people in fire affected areas with helpful resources.</p>
      <p>We work together as a nimble alliance focussed on making a difference, moving fast to build information systems needed by crisis affected communities. We're spread across AU and USA locations, integrating disaster response lessons learnt from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate, along with the lived experiences of our team members and peers like FindABed.</p>
      <p>Our international team is made up of individuals from organizations like Atlassian, Deloitte, Google, Canva, Thoughtworks, MapBox, RosieAlliance, Helping Homes, Assemblient and AusFireHack. Many of our team are using skills they learnt crowdsourcing rescue and information during the disasters in America due to Hurricanes Harvey & Maria.</p>
      <p>We saw individuals began offering help over social media to people affected by the Australian bushfires. In the scale of devastation and the number of folks rendered homeless and needing shelter, people began to offer what they could - accommodation for two people, 3 generators, a box of nappies, free paddock, agistment, pet boarding, fuel, and more.</p>
      <p>Concerned that the offers flying past might not be reaching the people who needed them, we formed to gather the offers into a central place. CrisisApp began as a Google sheet where people could post and find offers, then grew into a web-based app. There's more to come yet as we grow our capability and expand our focus on peoples pressing challenges. You can offer resources on our web form, and find help in our searchable web app, that works on a mobile phone.</p>
      <p>You can help. Go now to our web app at www.crisis.app to find and offer disaster resources. Tag us on social media - we are @thecrisisapp on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and @crisisapp on LinkedIn. People helping each other in times of disaster.</p>
